The purpose of this project is to be able to easily search the LCB of the state of PA for rare liquors. Users should be able to filter by type, name, location, and in-stock status. Ideally one would like the ability to retrieve the address and phone number of any store that has stock of a given bottle.

The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (LCB) does offer a public API for developers to access its data. This API is known as the "PLCB API" and provides programmatic access to a variety of information related to liquor licensing, product catalog, store inventory, and sales data.

To use the PLCB API, you need to first register and obtain an API key from the LCB. Once you have the API key, you can use it to make requests to the API and retrieve data in JSON format.

The documentation for the PLCB API can be found at the following URL: https://api.pa.gov/highway/v1/docs/index.html
